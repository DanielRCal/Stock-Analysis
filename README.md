### Summary: 

What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code? The main advantage of refactoring as we can see from the results is that the Macro is able to run faster.  
  The main disadvantage would be that there might be a increased chance of confusion when coding loops.  Using one iterator can simplify operation but can   have the ability to cause more error to decode.

How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
    There is a farely significant time difference between the original and refactored script.  If we had millions upon millions of data in a set, the time     difference in running this script would be magnified.
